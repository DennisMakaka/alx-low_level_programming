# Search Algorithms Project

## Introduction
This project contains implementations of various search algorithms in C. These algorithms include linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search, exponential search, advanced binary search, and linear search in skip lists. Each algorithm is implemented as a function in separate C files.

## Getting Started
To compile the programs, ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system. You can compile the programs using the provided Makefile or by manually compiling each source file.
