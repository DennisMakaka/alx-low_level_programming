# Makefiles

 the project is aimed at simplifying and automating te build process for software devlopment using makefiles. 

- Makefiles are powerful tools used to manage dependencies and streamline the compilation and linking of source code into executable programs. This project provides a standardized template and guidelines for creating efficient Makefiles, ensuring consistency and reliability across different projects.

## Use cases
- Building and managing large-scale software projects with complex dependencies.
- Enforcing coding standards and best practices across development.
- Integrating with continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
